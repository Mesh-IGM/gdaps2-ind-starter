# gdaps2-ind-starter

This is a template project for students to use in GDAPS 106 for their class work.

# Getting Started

Get your favorite Git client:
* [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
* Or just use [Visual Studio](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Visual-Studio)'s plugin


After you have done that, then your repo is all set! Just clone it and get to work!
If you have questions feel free to reach out to the TA on Discord or by email.

# Why are we using Git?

Some of you may be thinking: "Why are these silly people making me use _source control?!_"

Well, there are a ton of reasons.

Basically every software company uses some sort of source control throughout the
development process. It's an incredibly powerful tool that you should learn
to master in the same way that Arya Stark wields Needle.

Using Git will also make easier throughout the grading process, as we can
automate the downloading/updating of your work. Yay for workflow improvements!
